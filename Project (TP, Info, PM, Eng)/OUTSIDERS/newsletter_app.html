				Yesterday a boy, called P.C. 14 years old, was walking home alone from a movie.
				He was abruptly stopped by a gang of Socs who wanted to beat him up.
				The Socs badly injured and threaten to kill him. After some of his gang members helped him the socs fled away.
				The police arrived too late, but he is in the hospital and fortunately without major injuries.
